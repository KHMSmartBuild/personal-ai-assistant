# Troubleshooting Guide

## Overview

This guide provides solutions to common issues you may encounter while working with the AI Assistant system. It covers problems related to deployment, service failures, configuration errors, and more.

---

## 1. Deployment Issues

### 1.1. Helm Deployment Fails

- **Problem**: Helm deployment fails with an error related to missing values or resources.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure all required values are provided in the `values.yaml` file.
  2. Check for any missing Kubernetes resources such as PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
  3. Use `helm install --debug` to get more detailed error messages.

### 1.2. Kubernetes Pods Stuck in Pending State

- **Problem**: Pods remain in the "Pending" state and do not start.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check if there are enough resources (CPU, memory) available in the cluster.
  2. Ensure that the necessary PVCs are bound and available.
  3. Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to identify the cause of the issue.

### 1.3. Kubernetes Pods CrashLoopBackOff

- **Problem**: Pods keep restarting and enter a "CrashLoopBackOff" state.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check the pod logs using `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to identify the cause of the crash.
  2. Ensure that all environment variables and secrets are correctly set.
  3. Verify that the Docker images are correctly built and contain all necessary dependencies.

## 2. Service Issues

### 2.1. Service Not Accessible

- **Problem**: A service is not accessible via its endpoint.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check if the service is running using `kubectl get services` and `kubectl get pods`.
  2. Verify that the service is exposed correctly via a Kubernetes service or Ingress.
  3. Ensure that the service is listening on the correct port as defined in the deployment.

### 2.2. Service Returning 500 Internal Server Error

- **Problem**: A service returns a 500 Internal Server Error when accessed.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check the service logs for detailed error messages using `kubectl logs <pod-name>`.
  2. Ensure that the service has access to all required resources (e.g., databases, external APIs).
  3. Verify that all environment variables and configuration files are correct.

### 2.3. Service Fails to Start

- **Problem**: A service fails to start and keeps restarting.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check for configuration errors in the `config.yaml` file.
  2. Ensure that all required secrets and environment variables are set.
  3. Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to diagnose the issue.

## 3. Configuration Issues

### 3.1. Missing or Incorrect Environment Variables

- **Problem**: Services are not picking up environment variables or are using incorrect values.
- **Solution**:
  1. Verify that the environment variables are correctly set in the Kubernetes deployment or Helm chart.
  2. Check for typos or incorrect references in the environment variable names.
  3. Ensure that any referenced secrets or ConfigMaps exist and are correctly linked.

### 3.2. Incorrect Database Configuration

- **Problem**: Services cannot connect to the database.
- **Solution**:
  1. Check the database connection details (host, port, username, password) in the `config.yaml` file.
  2. Ensure that the database service is running and accessible within the Kubernetes cluster.
  3. Verify that the correct database secrets are being used.

## 4. Security Issues

### 4.1. Unauthorized Access Attempts

- **Problem**: Logs show repeated unauthorized access attempts.
- **Solution**:
  1. Implement rate limiting on the API endpoints to prevent brute force attacks.
  2. Ensure that all sensitive endpoints are protected by authentication and authorization mechanisms.
  3. Monitor logs and set up alerts for unusual activity.

### 4.2. Sensitive Data Exposed in Logs

- **Problem**: Sensitive data appears in service logs.
- **Solution**:
  1. Review logging configurations to ensure that sensitive information is not logged.
  2. Implement data masking or obfuscation for sensitive information in logs.
  3. Regularly audit logs for any accidental exposure of sensitive data.

## 5. Monitoring and Logging Issues

### 5.1. Missing Logs or Metrics

- **Problem**: Logs or metrics are missing or incomplete in the monitoring system.
- **Solution**:
  1. Ensure that the logging and monitoring agents (e.g., Fluentd, Prometheus) are correctly configured and running.
  2. Check the configuration files for any filters that might be excluding important logs or metrics.
  3. Verify that the correct log files and directories are being monitored.

### 5.2. High Latency or Timeouts in Monitoring

- **Problem**: The monitoring system is slow or experiencing timeouts.
- **Solution**:
  1. Optimize the queries and dashboards in Grafana to reduce load on the monitoring system.
  2. Increase the resources (CPU, memory) allocated to the monitoring and logging services.
  3. Check for network issues that might be affecting communication between monitoring components.

## 6. General Debugging Tips

### 6.1. Use `kubectl describe`

- Use `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` to get detailed information about a pod, including events that might indicate why it's failing.

### 6.2. Check Logs

- Use `kubectl logs <pod-name>` to check the logs of a specific pod. This is often the quickest way to identify the cause of an issue.

### 6.3. Monitor Resource Usage

- Use `kubectl top pods` to monitor the CPU and memory usage of your pods. Resource exhaustion can often lead to unexpected behavior.

### 6.4. Test with `curl`

- Use `curl` commands to test API endpoints from within the cluster. This can help verify that services are running and accessible.

### 6.5. Restart Services

- Sometimes, simply restarting a service can resolve transient issues. Use `kubectl rollout restart deployment <deployment-name>` to restart a service.
