# Developer Guide

## Overview

Welcome to the AI Assistant Developer Guide. This document will help you set up your development environment, understand the project architecture, and provide guidelines for contributing to the project.

---

## Setting Up the Development Environment

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Kubernetes** and **Helm**
- **Python 3.9**
- **Git**

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assistant.git

cd ai-assistant
```

**Setting Up Python Virtual Environment**:

Set up a Python virtual environment to manage your dependencies:

```
python3 -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Building and Running Services Locally**:

You can use Docker Compose to build and run the services locally:

```
docker-compose up --build
```

**Running Tests**:

To ensure everything is working correctly, run the unit tests:

```
pytest services/nlp-agent/tests
pytest services/routine-detection-agent/tests
```

## Project Architecture

### Overview

The AI Assistant project is built using a microservices architecture, with each service designed to perform a specific function within the system. Each service is containerized using Docker and managed through Kubernetes.

### Microservices

**NLP Agent**: Handles natural language processing tasks, analyzing user inputs and generating responses.
**Routine Detection Agent**: Analyzes user routines and patterns to provide insights or automate tasks.
**Security and Privacy Agent**: Manages encryption and decryption of sensitive data, ensuring privacy.
**Feedback and Improvement Agent**: Collects user feedback and triggers improvements in the system.
**Proactive Assistance Agent**: Provides proactive suggestions to users based on their context and preferences.
**Task Management Agent**: Manages user tasks, reminders, and schedules.

### Communication

Services communicate via RESTful APIs over HTTP.
Kubernetes services and deployments handle the internal communication within the cluster.

### Contributing Guidelines

To maintain a high standard of code quality and project consistency, please adhere to the following guidelines:

**Code Style**: Ensure your code follows the existing style conventions. Use PEP 8 for Python code.
**Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for any new features or bug fixes.

### Documentation

Update documentation if your changes affect any part of the system.

Making a Contribution

Fork the repository: Create your own copy of the repository.

Create a new branch: Develop your feature or bugfix in a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Commit your changes: Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git commit -m "Add new feature"
```

Push your branch: Push the branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Open a pull request: Submit your changes for review by opening a pull request.

Debugging and Troubleshooting

Logs

Logs for each service can be accessed using Docker or Kubernetes commands. For Docker, use `docker logs <container_id>`. For Kubernetes, use `kubectl logs <pod_name>`.

Common Issues

Service Fails to Start: Check the Dockerfile and environment variables for any misconfigurations.
Dependency Issues: Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed in the virtual environment or Docker image.

Best Practices

Environment Variables: Use environment variables for configuration, especially for sensitive information.
Keep Dependencies Updated: Regularly update your dependencies to avoid security vulnerabilities and ensure compatibility.
Testing: Run tests frequently to catch any issues early in the development process.
Documentation: Keep the documentation up-to-date to help other developers and maintainers.
