- **Routine Detection:** Identifies and adapts to user routines, offering timely assistance.
- **Personalized Preferences:** Learns and adapts to user preferences over time.
- **Contextual Awareness:** Provides relevant information and suggestions based on user context (location, time, etc.).
- **Task Management:** Helps users manage tasks, appointments, and reminders efficiently.
- **Secure and Private:** Implements robust security measures to protect user data and privacy.
- **Scalable and Modular:** Built using microservices and containerized for easy scaling and maintenance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine
- [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) cluster up and running
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed for Kubernetes management
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-assistant.git
cd ai-assistant
```

# Build and Deploy with Docker

1. **Build the Docker images:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the containers:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

# Deploy to Kubernetes

1. **Initialize Helm:**

   ```bash
   helm init
   ```

2. **Deploy the services using Helm charts:**

   ```bash
   helm install --name nlp-agent ./charts/nlp-agent
   helm install --name postgres ./charts/postgres
   helm install --name redis ./charts/redis
   ```

# Environment Configuration

- Copy the example environment files:

  ```bash
  cp config/env/dev.env.example config/env/dev.env
  cp config/env/prod.env.example config/env/prod.env
  ```

- Adjust the environment variables as needed.

## Usage

### Interacting with the Assistant

- Once the system is up and running, you can interact with the AI Assistant through the API Gateway or directly via services exposed in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Example API Call

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/nlp-agent/analyze" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "query": "What's the weather like today?"
}'
```

## Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The AI Assistant is designed as a collection of microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the assistant's functionality. Services communicate with each other over REST APIs and are deployed in a Kubernetes cluster for scalability and fault tolerance.

### Components

- **NLP Agent:** Handles natural language processing and understanding.
- **Routine Detection Agent:** Monitors and adapts to user behavior.
- **Task Management Agent:** Manages tasks, reminders, and schedules.
- **Contextual Awareness Agent:** Provides context-based suggestions and information.
- **Security and Privacy Agent:** Ensures data protection and privacy compliance.
- **API Gateway:** Routes external requests to the appropriate backend services.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Tracks system performance and logs events for analysis.
